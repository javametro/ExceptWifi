Capturing the screen, compressing it into a video stream, and transmitting it over a LAN cable (along with audio) is a complex task that typically involves several libraries and technologies working together. Here's a high-level overview of the process and the major components involved:

**1. Screen Capture:**

- **Library:** You'll need a library to capture the screen's contents. Popular choices include:
    - **GDI/GDI+ (Windows):** Lower-level, but offers more control over the capture process.
    - **DirectX (Windows):** Higher-level, can capture from games and hardware-accelerated applications.
    - **ffmpeg (Cross-platform):** Powerful and flexible library with screen capture capabilities.

- **Considerations:**
    - **Capture Rate:** Determine how many frames per second (FPS) you want to capture. This will affect the smoothness of the video stream.
    - **Region of Interest:** Decide if you want to capture the entire screen or a specific region.

**2. Audio Capture:**

- **Library:** Similar to screen capture, you'll need a library for audio capture. Options include:
    - **Windows Core Audio APIs (Windows):** Low-level, but provides access to audio devices.
    - **PortAudio (Cross-platform):** Higher-level, simplifies audio input/output.

**3. Video and Audio Encoding:**

- **Library:**  You'll need a video and audio encoder to compress the raw data into a streamable format.
    - **H.264 (Video):**  Highly efficient video codec, widely supported.
    - **AAC (Audio):** Popular audio codec, good balance of quality and compression.
    - **ffmpeg:** Again, ffmpeg can be used for both video and audio encoding.

- **Considerations:**
    - **Bitrate:** Choose the bitrate for video and audio based on your network bandwidth and desired quality.
    - **Encoding Speed:**  Consider hardware-accelerated encoding if you need high performance.

**4. Streaming Protocol:**

- **Choice:**
    - **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** Designed for real-time media streaming.
    - **RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol):** Used for controlling media servers and streams.
    - **MPEG-TS (Transport Stream):** Widely used for broadcasting and digital video.
    - **Custom TCP or UDP Protocol:** If you want more flexibility or have specific requirements.

**5. Network Communication:**

- **Sockets:** You'll likely use TCP or UDP sockets for transmitting the encoded video and audio data over the LAN cable. 
- **Considerations:**
    - **Error Handling:**  Handle network errors gracefully (e.g., packet loss, disconnections).
    - **Latency:** Minimize latency for a smoother real-time experience.


**Example Code Structure (Conceptual):**
 
**Server:**
```c++
//1. Initialize Winsock
//2. Create Socket
//3. Bind to Port
//4. Listen For Connections
//5. Accept Connections
//6. Receive Video and audio stream 
//7. Close
```
**Client:**

```c++
//1. Initialize Winsock
//2. Create socket
//3. Connect to server
//4. Capture Screen + Audio Data
//5. Encode video and audio stream
//6. Send Data
//7. Close
```
**Libraries/Frameworks:**
- **FFmpeg:** Versatile library for video/audio encoding, decoding, and streaming.
- **OpenCV:** Primarily for computer vision, but can also be used for video capture.
- **SDL:** Cross-platform library for multimedia, including audio capture and video rendering.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Performance:** Screen capture and video encoding can be computationally intensive. Optimize your code and consider hardware acceleration if needed.
- **Security:** If you're transmitting sensitive information, implement appropriate security measures (e.g., encryption).


This is a very simplified outline. Building a full-fledged screen-sharing application with audio is a significant project that requires careful planning and implementation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
